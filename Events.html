<!-- HTML Events
an html event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

some example of html events
an html web page has finished loading
an html input field was changed
an html button was clicked

often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
js lets you execute code when events are detected.
html allows event handler attributes, with js code, to be added to html elements.

common html events : 
onchange : an html element has been changed.
onclick : the user clicks an html element.
onmouseover : the user moves the mouse over an html element.
onmouseout : the user moves the mouse away from an html element.
onkeydown : the user pushes a keyboard key.
onload : the browser has finished loading the page.
